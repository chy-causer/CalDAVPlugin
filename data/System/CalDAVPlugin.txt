%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin provides a link between a remote
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV][CalDAV]] server and the
CalendarPlugin. !CalDAV is a protocol used by many calendaring applications,
the most notable being iCal on Apple products.

The plugin works by accessing a calendar on the !CalDAV server and
generating an event list in the "bulleted event list" format that
the !CalendarPlugin uses.

%TOC%

---++ Usage
Put the macro =%<nop>CALDAV{"calendar"}% anywhere on a topic. The
CalendarPlugin will automatically pick up the events from it.

| *Parameter* | *Meaning* |
| ="calendar"= | The name of a declared calendar |
| =url= | The url of a remote calendar you want to view |
| =user= | Username used to access the remote calendar |
| =pass= | Password for the user used to access the remote calendar |
| =stop= | Hard stop for recurrences. This takes two values, separated by commas. The first value specifies the maximum number of events generated by a single recurrence, and the second value specifies the maximum number of days to generate events for. For example, =stop="50,365"= (the default) will prevent any recurrence generating more than 50 events, or any events more than 365 days from now. |

For obvious security reasons, you are recommended to use the ="calendar"= method to specify the calendar to retrieve.

Note that the !CalendarPlugin does not support a wide range of recurrences,
and the !CalDAVPlugin will generate individual events for recurrences that
it can't map to the !CalendarPlugin. The limits for the number of events
generated for each recurrence can be configured using the plugin parameters.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%
